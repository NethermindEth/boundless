# Why Boundless?

A story of re-execution: ZK execution vs Blockchain Execution
Traditional blockchains rely on a "global re-execution" model, where every node redundantly processes every transaction to achieve consensus on the network's state. This model, while secure and transparent, places strict limits on computation because each node must repeat the same operations. The result is capped throughput and high costs, which constrain high-demand applications and make complex on-chain computations unsustainable.

Boundless redefines blockchain execution with ZK-powered verifiable computing to break through these limitations. Rather than requiring every node to re-execute transactions, Boundless enables a single node to handle the computation and generate a zero-knowledge proof verifying its correctness. This proof is then verified by the network, ensuring consensus with minimal re-execution. This decoupling of execution from verification, drastically reduces the computation each node must perform.

Boundless enables "abundant compute" on any blockchain by leveraging a decentralized proof market to handle complex computations and generate succinct, reusable proofs. These proofs, verified on-chain, act as building blocks for innovation while driving efficiency through aggregation as demand grows. With each new prover on the market adding capacity and each new application amplifying benefits, the network strengthens and scales, creating a self-reinforcing system of increasing computational power and efficiency.
