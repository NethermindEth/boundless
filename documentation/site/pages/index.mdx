Boundless is the first universal ZK protocol that transforms how blockchains compute. By turning complex computations into lightweight, verifiable proofs, Boundless enables applications to scale seamlessly across all chains—no compromises, no limits.
With Boundless, developers can write and deploy sophisticated applications once deemed impossible. Build without worrying about infrastructure, execution limits, or compute overhead. Our Core Services handle proof generation, aggregation, and settlement, while Extensions like Steel and Kailua unlock unprecedented cost savings and speed—all using the tools and languages you already know.
Boundless lets you focus on building the future. We'll handle the rest.
